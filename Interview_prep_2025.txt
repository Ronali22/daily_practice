JAVA:-
============
OOPS[object oriented programming]
----------------------------------
Note: 
* variables=>properties, fields
* methods=>behaviours, functions
* in java every classes extends Object class by default.

1.Inheritance
--------------
->Acquiring properties from parent class to child class.
-> type
a. single inheritance-> one parent and one child class
b. multiple inheritance-> not supported (in terms of classes not supported, in terms interface supported)
c. multilevel inheritance-> one child, one parent, one grand parent class...... and so on
d. cyclic inheritance-> inter dependent classes
=> in terms of classes, java doesnot support multiple inheritance. it causes diamond problem thats why.
diamond problem: as object class is parent of every other class, when we create a child class named Vehicle, which extends two parent classes as Car, Bike. both parent classes are having a method as start(). in this scenario the java compiler will get confuse which start() method to be called.

2.Polymorphism
----------------
-> same name but different behaviour
example:- 
public int add(int a, int b){return a+b;}
public String add(String a, String b){return a+b;}
-> types
a. Run type polymorphism-> method overloading( in same class, multiple methods with same name and different arguments)
b. complie type polymorphism-> Method overriding (in different class, multiple methods with same name and different arguments)

3.Abstraction
--------------
-> Hiding unwanted implementation and providing useful methods.
-> By using abstract classes and interfaces we can achieve abstraction.
-> If a class contains atleast one abstract method, then that class is known as abstract class.
->Abstract method- a method without implementation is known as abstract method. ex: public void engineStart();

4.Encapsulation
----------------
-> Binding properties and behaviours in a single unit.
-> To achieve encapsulation we have to declare all the properties/variables/fields as 'private' and to access those we have to provide public methods, known as setters and getters.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exception Handling:
-------------------
-> Unwanted abroption/termination of program during normal execution is known as exception.
Types:
------
1.Unchecked exception/Run-time exception
----------------------------------------
-> The exception which can't be checked by compiler at compile time.
-> ex: ArithmaticException, NullPointerException, IndexOutOfBoundException, ClassCastException

2.Checked exception/Compile-time exception
------------------------------------------
-> The exception which can be checked by compiler at compile time.
-> ex: ClassNotFoundException, IOException(FileNotFoundException, Interrupted IOException), SQLException

--> Exception can be handlled using 1. try........catch block 2. throw and throws 3.finally block

1. try...catch block
----------------------
class Math {
public static void main(String[] args) {
      int a = 100;
      int b = 0;
try{
      int c = a/b;
      System.out.println(c);
} catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println(c);
}
}
}
